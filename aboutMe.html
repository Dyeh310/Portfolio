                              <p>My name is Nicholas and I love creating software. I am originally from a small town in
                                    Louisiana, but decided to move and pursue my career in the Washington, DC area. I
                                    love
                                    where I live and enjoy the numerous opportunities that comes with living in the
                                    nationâ€™s
                                    capital!
                              </p>

                                    I have spent the last 8 years getting three degrees at two different universities.
                                    For a
                                    long time, I studied history, receiving both a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts.
                                    My
                                    particular focus was Mexican-American civil rights in the Southwestern United
                                    States.
                                    Although I loved learning about different cultures and their history, I found I was
                                    not
                                    satisfied with my career. I decided to pursue a curiosity that has always lived with
                                    me,
                                    understanding software. After teaching myself some basic coding skills, I took the
                                    leap
                                    back into school and earned my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.

                                    In my free time you will find me working on various person projects (such as games
                                    and
                                    mobile and web applications), playing video/computer games with friends, or reading
                                    philosophy. I am extremely excited for the next chapter in my life as a professional
                                    software developer!
