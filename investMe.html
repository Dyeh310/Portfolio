                                    The home screen acts as the first page you will see when launching InvestMe. For
                                    returning users, entering your username
                                    and password will unlock your account. New users should click the link at the bottom
                                    to start setting up a new account.
                                    The app allows users to create an InvestMe account using their Google and Facebook
                                    credentials. This is completed on the
                                    page utilized for creating a new account.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    I created the design page to set the style for the entire app. For instance, the
                                    size and width of the input boxes, the
                                    font style, and the color scheme became a key part of the app. Users expect
                                    consistency and will see the same patterns
                                    throughout. As this was my first time writing in Dart and using Flutter, the
                                    learning curve took some time. Fortunately,
                                    Dart is a C-derivative and styling Flutter widgets is similar to using CSS. After
                                    completing the layout of the page, the
                                    team hooked the application to Google’s Firebase, effectively allowing users to
                                    login and store data.
                              </p>

                                    One of the key features is the ability for users to be able to log their
                                    expenditures. This page presents an easy to
                                    read, self-explanatory interface. Below the “Enter Amount” text, a calendar icon is
                                    available (defaulted to the present
                                    date), so that users can date their input. After, the user can input the amount and
                                    name of the expenditure, and any
                                    additional notes they find helpful. Clicking save then logs the entry into the
                                    Firebase database.
                              </p>
                              <p>
                                    Users who are utilizing the app properly, will be returning to this page often. Each
                                    purchase, specifically purchases
                                    that may be viewed as unnecessary (coffee, snacks, etc), should be logged and dated.
                                    By doing so, InvestMe will have
                                    accurate user data to compare the stock market data against. This will allow the app
                                    to provide accurate suggestions.

                                    Investing is complicated, and most people do not know where to start. This app was
                                    designed for users such as this. The
                                    tutorial page consists of a slider of three separate screens that explain exactly
                                    what InvestMe does. It describes how
                                    the user can log their data, view recent expenditures, and compare data with stock
                                    information. InvestMe was designed
                                    with simplicity in mind and I did not believe the tutorial needed to appear more
                                    than once. For this reason, the
                                    tutorial only appears the first time a user logs into the account.
                              </p>
                        </div>
                  </div>

                                    This page acts as the user’s control center for checking stocks and preparing stocks
                                    to be compared with their
                                    expenditures. At the top of the page there is a search box that searches the Alpha
                                    Vantage API for the user’s input. If
                                    the input is found that stock will appear at the bottom section of the screen. From
                                    here, the user can mark the stock as
                                    a “favorite.” Now this stock will be tracked and used when comparing inputs to the
                                    Alpha Vantage API.

                                    Although the point of InvestMe was not to be just another way to check stock data,
                                    that ability was something we
                                    recognized when developing the app. The My Stocks page could allow users to keep
                                    track of stocks they are interested in,
                                    in addition to being able to prepare them for comparison. When a user gets tired of
                                    a watching a particular stock, they
                                    can simply remove them from the list.
