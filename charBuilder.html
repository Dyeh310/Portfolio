                        The Welcome Page is the first thing new users will see when entering the app. The page contains
                        two fields, an email and
                        password field, and two clickable links, a button and hyperlinked text. For returning users,
                        they can enter their
                        authentication credentials that were created when they first made their account, this will take
                        them to the Character
                        List page once submit it clicked. For new users, clicking the “Sign Up!” text will bring them to
                        a page to create a new
                        account.

                        This app was designed with simplicity in mind. It was intended to cut through the complexity of
                        other character creation
                        apps. I incorporated this idea into the style of the application as well. Each page from the
                        Welcome Page, to the
                        Character Creation page is meant to complete a single task.

                        The Character List page contains a list of all characters registered to this account. Each time
                        a new character is
                        created, the character will be appended to the list. Each name is a hypertext link that will
                        take the user to the that
                        specific character’s page. At the bottom of the page is a button that will bring the user to the
                        Create New Character
                        page.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The page was designed to be the “control room” of the app. From here, users are able to select
                        all of their registered
                        characters and add new ones. For players using multiple characters in a game, simply pressing
                        back after selecting a
                        character, will return you to this page so you can select a new character quickly. The two pages
                        were designed for this
                        interconnective behavior.

                        Investing is complicated, and most people do not know where to start. This app was
                        designed for users such as this. The
                        tutorial page consists of a slider of three separate screens that explain exactly
                        what InvestMe does. It describes how
                        the user can log their data, view recent expenditures, and compare data with stock
                        information. InvestMe was designed
                        with simplicity in mind and I did not believe the tutorial needed to appear more
                        than once. For this reason, the
                        tutorial only appears the first time a user logs into the account.

                        From the Character List Page, to the Character Page, there is a button that will bring the user
                        to the Edit character
                        Page. This page allows the user to make any and all alterations to the currently selected
                        character. The name field and
                        all other fields will be editable. For instance, if a character has the stat of “Health” with a
                        current value of “40,”
                        you could easily change “Health” to “Life” and “40” to “30.” Furthermore, users can add
                        additional fields to their
                        characters with the click of a button. Ideally, users would have this page up during a game
                        session to make quick
                        alterations to any stats that are changing in-game. At the very bottom of the page there is a
                        toggle that will stop the
                        Confirmation Page from appearing when a user saves the changes. It could become tedious to
                        constantly be saving changes
                        and going through the Confirmation Page during a game.
